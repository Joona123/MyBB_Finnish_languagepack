# MyBB Finnish languagepack
A Finnish languagepack for MyBB Forum Software. 

You can download this languagepack and then just place the files to inc/languages. You can change the translations the way you want. 

Everything should work, but if it doesn't, report to the email address I've added to http://github.com/joona123
